### Front-end

"We are developing the front-end for a healthcare application. The 'Chat' page has already been designed and its current functionality should be retained as you can see. We now need to implement the user interface for three additional pages, accessible via a tab-based navigation system at the bottom of the screen.

Please focus solely on the front-end UI implementation. Do NOT interfere with any backend logic or core functionality at this stage. We will build out the full application capabilities incrementally.

Here are the details for the new pages:

Tab bar controller at top-level (bottom bar) with the following pages:

1. **Dashboard Page:**
    - Display a clear count of 'Number of devices visible'.
    - Display a clear count of 'Number of patient data records stored'.
2. **Patients Page:**
    - **Patient List View:** Show a list of all stored patient data. Each patient entry should be clickable.
    - **Patient Detail View:** When a patient entry is clicked, display their detailed data.
    - **Add Patient Functionality:** Include a prominent 'Add' button. Clicking this button should present a form for adding new patient data, incorporating all the details outlined in the `modifications.md` file.
3. **Chat Page:**
    - Retain its existing design and layout.

**Navigation:**
The user must be able to seamlessly navigate between the 'Dashboard', 'Patients', and 'Chat' pages using three distinct tabs located at the bottom of the screen.

Please write concise and maintainable code, using all of the context available to you. Make a todo list for yourself and implement interatively just like a senior dev.

DO NOT TOUCH CHANGE THE EXISTING BACKEND LOGIC OR FUNCTIONALITY. 

ONLY CHANGE FRONT-END CODE.
